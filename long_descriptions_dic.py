    'wages': """These are real wages, i.e. "Daily building labourers' wage divided by a daily subsistence basket" for China compiled by Pim de Zwart, Bas van Leeuwen and Jieli van Leeuwen-Li. They comment: "The wage and price series shown in this chapter are taken from three sources: (A) a variety of studies on historical real wages that appeared in academic journals and books; (B) the British Colonial Blue Books (circa 1840-1912); and (C) the October Enquiries of the International Labour Organisation (1924-2008). These data were then converted into subsistence ratios, which indicate how many times the daily wage of a male unskilled construction labourer can buy the daily subsistence basket. This methodology has the advantage of providing an absolute yardstick to compare welfare across countries and time periods and, hence, is conceptually close (but not identical) to purchasing power parities. Finally, in order to fill gaps in the data, interpolations were made (D) on the basis of real wages indices from the (older) literature.""",
